## ðŸ’»ðŸ’»Take a quick start
### Using git to clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/xuwayyy/WBANet.git
cd WBANet
```

### Run in default parameters in terminal
```
python main.py
```

### Run in custom parameters setting in terminal
```
python main.py --dataset sulzberger --batchsize 128 --epoches 20 --lr 1e-4 --gamma 0.8 --patchsize 16
```

### You could also run it in Google-Colab
Colab Link: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
### Special Caution
If you are a undergraduate student in OUC researching SAR Image Change Detection, I strongly recommend you to follow the style of the ```Python``` version because it provides a at least systematic way for a whole training process, the colab one could get the correct result as well but the coding style is bad in some way.
